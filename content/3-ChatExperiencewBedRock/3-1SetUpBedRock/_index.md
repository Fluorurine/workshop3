Use **Amazon Bedrock** to build and scale generative AI applications with FMs. **Amazon Bedrock** is a fully managed service that makes FMs, from leading AI startups and Amazon, available through an API. You can choose from a wide range of FMs to find the model that is best suited for your use case. With the **Amazon Bedrock** serverless experience, you can get started quickly, privately customize FMs with your own data, and quickly integrate and deploy them into your applications by using AWS tools without having to manage any infrastructure.


Sign in to the **AWS Management Console**, and then type `Bedrock` in the console search box. Review to ensure that your AWS account has access to **Amazon Bedrock**, and then select the AWS Region where this workshop is running; for example, US East (N. Virginia).
